"""Colors points or packed primitives based on their falloff attribute value."""

This node simply applies a ramp to colorize packed primitives or points based on their `@mops_falloff` attribute value.
Note that packed fragments cannot properly preview falloff due to a viewport limitation; if you want to preview falloff on packed fragments, try enabling Display as Sprites.

@inputs

Input Points or Packed Prims:
    The points or packed primitives to colorize.
    
@parameters

Preview Falloff:
    #id: do_preview
    Enable colorization.
    
Display as Sprites:
    #id: do_sprite
    Display the packed primitives as sprites (flat images) instead of their actual geometry. This is to allow for falloff visualization on packed fragments, which cannot be tinted by a Cd attribute in the viewport.

Sprite Map:
    #id: spritemap
    The image to use for sprites, if enabled.
    
Sprite Scale:
    #id: spritescale
    The scale of the sprite images. The default scale is based on the extracted `@pscale` of the source packed primitives, but this attribute may be inaccurate for many packed primitives. This slider scales down the sprites in the viewport.
    
Override Scale:
    #id: override_scale
    Instead of guessing at a scale for the sprites, this allows you to set all sprites to a single scale.
