"""Subdivides a geometry's polygons based on a falloff value."""


This node subdivides a geometry's polygons based on a falloff value. The falloff value (f@mops_falloff) should be a point attribute on the incoming geometry. The falloff values should be in the range of 0 - 1. A value of 1 wmeans the a polygon will be subdivided the value that's set in the "Max Subdivisions" slider.

@inputs

Geometry:
    Plug in geometry that should be subdivided in here.

@parameters

== General ==

Max Subdivisions:
    #id: maxsubs

    Maximum number of times a polygon will be subdivided.
    
Extrude Strength:
    #id: extrudeamt

    Maximum distance a polygon will be extruded each subdivision step.
    
Extrusion Falloff Exponent:
    #id: scaleexp

    The extrusion's distance will decrease each subdivision step. This exponent drives how strongly it decreases. Higher values means tronger decrease.
    
Min Area:
    #id: minarea

    Minimum area to subdivide. If polygon's area is smaller than this, it won't be subdivided/extruded.
    
Recompute Normals:
    #id: recompN

    Recalculates the geometry's normals after extrusion.
                    
    
Falloff Attribute:
    #id: falloff_attr
    The point attribute to use as the falloff attribute.
    
Output Groups:
    #id: doprimgroups
    If enabled, create primitive groups for the inside, outside, and front faces of each subdivision.
