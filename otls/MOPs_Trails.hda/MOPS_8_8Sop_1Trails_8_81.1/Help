"""Generates stable, oriented trails with UVs from moving points or packed primitives."""

MOPs Trails is a simulation that generates trails from incoming animated points. The entire range of motion is computed up-front (based on the Start Frame and End Frame parameters), so that even after resampling or reorienting the trails are completely stable and will never jitter.

Trails will automatically inherit point attributes from the source points, but it can optionally generate new UVs and orientation for you. MOPs Trails can also clip the trails to a given length, or clip them based on age. Note that trails are connected based on a unique integer point attribute (the i@id attribute by default). 

NOTE:
    The simulation will run through its entire length before clipping the trails afterwards in order to ensure stability. Minimizing the duration of the simulation is a good idea to reduce cook time, especially when lots of points are involved. It's a good idea to cache the results before rendering.

TIP:
    If you want to render the trails as ribbons or wires, consider using [MOPs Sweep Spline|Node:/sop/MOPS--Sweep_Spline-1.1] to turn the trails into geometry.
    
== Overview ==

@inputs

Input Points:
    The points or packed primitives to generate trails from.
    
@parameters

== General ==

Start Frame:
    #id: startframe
    The first frame to generate trails from.
    
End Frame:
    #id: endframe
    The last frame to generate trails from.
    
Snap Distance:
    #id: tol3d
    The minimum distance between trailed points. Any points closer together than this will be fused.
    
Trail Attribute:
    #id: attrname
    The name of an integer point attribute used to connect trailed points together.
    
Resample Trails:
    #id: do_resample
    If enabled, the trails will be resampled after generation. See the Resample SOP for details.
    
Orient Trails:
    #id: do_orient
    If enabled, the trail points will be reoriented after generation (by default they inherit any orientation from the source points). See [MOPs Orient Curve|Node:/sop/MOPS--Orient_Curve-1.0] for details.
    
== Attributes ==
    
Create Trail UVs:
    #id: do_uv
    If enabled, generate UVs for the trails. Each trail will be individually parameterized from 0-1. These UVs are stable as the trail is clipped over time. 
    
UV Attribute:
    #id: uvattrib
    The name of the vector point attribute to generate for UVs.
    
Inherit Attributes:
    #id: inherit_attrs
    A list of attributes to inherit from the source points.
    
Create Trail Falloff:
    #id: do_trail_falloff
    If enabled, create a Falloff attribute over the parametric length of each trail (0-1, starting from each trail head).
    
Falloff Attribute:
    #id: trail_falloff_attr
    The name of the Falloff attribute to generate if Create Trail Falloff is enabled.
    
== Output ==

Trails Group Name:
    #id: groupname
    The name of the point group the trails will be placed into.
        
Clipping Mode:
    #id: clip_mode
    The method by which to clip the tail ends of the trails.
    * None: Do not clip the tails.
    * Duration: Tails are clipped over time based on the Max Duration parameter, scaled by the Falloff attribute if Do Falloff is enabled.
    * Length: Tails are clipped based on a maximum arc length, scaled by the Falloff attribute if Do Falloff is enabled.
        
Randomize Length:
    #id: randomize_length
    If enabled, each trail's total length is randomly clipped between the minimum and maximum Random Range values.
