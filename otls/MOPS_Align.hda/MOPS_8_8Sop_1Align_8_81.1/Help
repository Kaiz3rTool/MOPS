"""Aligns packed primitives and/or their pivots."""

MOPs Align can modify the positions and pivots of packed primitives to align them based on their underlying bounding boxes. This means you can have them all scale up from their lowest point in Y, for example, without having to manually set the pivots of each of the instances in the MOPs Instancer. You can also set the pivot point manually to any position in space via a channel or a VEXpression, allowing for more complex transformations or FK-like behavior.

TIP:
    The Custom Pivot (Local) option works best when modifying pivots of Packed Alembic transforms.

Packed Primitives:
    The packed primitives to transform.
    
@parameters

== General ==

Use Falloff:
    #id: do_falloff
    Enable the `mops_falloff` attribute. This means that any adjustments you make to pivots or positions will be influenced by the falloff value.

Falloff Attribute:
    #id: falloff_attr 
    The name of the point attribute to use as the falloff attribute.
    
Pivots Only:
    #id: pivots_only
    If enabled, the pivots of the packed primitives will be adjusted without modifying their positions in space.
    
Align To:
    #id: mode
    Choose the bounding box axis to align primitives to. There are four special modes:
    * Centroid: Reset the pivots to each packed primitive's centroid.
    * Custom Offset: Add an offset to the existing pivots.
    * Custom Pivot (Local): Apply a single pivot to all primitives, in the local space of each primitive. This works best with Packed Alembic transform data.
    * Custom Pivot (World): Apply a single pivot to all primitives in world space. This means that all primitives will transform around a single point, much like the Transform SOP.
    
Pivot Offset:
    #id: pivot_offset
    Available only in "Custom Offset" mode. The offset to add to all pivots.
    
New Pivot:
    #id: pivot_absolute
    Available only in "Custom Pivot" mode. The new pivot to apply to all primitives.
