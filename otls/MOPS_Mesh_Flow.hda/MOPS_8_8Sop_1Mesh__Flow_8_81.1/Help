""" Initializes N and up vectors for use by MOPs Move Along Mesh. """

The MOPs Orient Mesh Modifier can be used to quickly generate normal and up vectors for use by MOPs Move Along Mesh. The resulting vectors can be further modified by a Comb SOP or any other point operation.

== Overview ==

@inputs
Input Mesh:
    The polygon mesh to generate flow vectors on.
    
@parameters

== General ==

Compute Method:
    #id: compute_method
    The method by which to compute the flow vectors on the mesh.
    * Compute From Polygons: Use the mesh topology to automatically create normal and up vectors. This behavior is identical to using the [Polyframe SOP|Node:sop/polyframe].
    * N and Up: Use existing mesh normals plus a defined up vector.
    * Use Orient: Use an existing p@orient quaternion attribute.
    
Compute Normals:
    #id: do_normal
    Compute point normals on the input mesh.
    
Create Up:
    #id: do_up
    Create a v@up point attribute on the input mesh.

Auto Up:
    #id: auto_up
    If enabled, automatically compute the up vector by calculating the difference between the local N and world N (+Z), then applying that same difference to world up (+Y). This matches the behavior of the Copy SOP when an `up` attribute is undefined.
    
Up Vector:
    #id: up_vector
    The up vector to use with the "N and Up" Compute Method if "Create Up" is enabled.
    
    
Invert N:
    #id: invert_N
    Invert the existing point normals.
    
Invert Up:
    #id: invert_up
    Invert the up vector.
    
Cross Up Vector:
    #id: do_cross
    Compute the cross product of the existing up vector with the normal vector, and bind the result to up. This can create the effect of the up vectors "flowing" over the surface.
    
Enable Curl Noise:
    #id: do_curl
    Blend the mesh flow vectors with curl noise.
    
Enable Blur:
    #id: do_blur
    Blur the resulting N and up vectors after computing them.
   
== Curl Noise ==

Blend With Original:
    #id: bias
    The amount to blend the curl noise in with the initial flow vectors. A value of 1.0 outputs entirely curl noise.
    
Use Rest Position:
    #id: use_rest
    If the input mesh has a v@rest point attribute, use this attribute to lookup the noise values instead of position (@P).
    
== Blur ==

See the Attribute Blur SOP for details.
