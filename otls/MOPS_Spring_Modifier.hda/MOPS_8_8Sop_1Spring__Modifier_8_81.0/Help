""" Applies spring forces to object transforms. """

The MOPs Spring Modifier applies physically-based spring forces to add "bounce" to animated primitives. Objects must already be animated for this modifier to have any effect.

== Overview ==

@inputs

MOPs Primitives:
    The packed primitives to apply spring motion to.
    
@parameters

== Simulation Settings ==

Mass:
    #id: M
    The mass of the primitives. This represents how much primitives will resist changes in velocity.
    
Spring Constant:
    #id: K
    The spring constant, from Hooke's Law, is roughly a measure of a spring's "stiffness." Higher numbers mean stiffer springs.
    
Damping Coefficient:
    #id: D
    The amount of energy conserved between timesteps. The default value 0.9 means that 10% of the spring's energy is lost ("dampened") each timestep. A value of 1.0 means the springs would oscillate forever.
    
Position:
    #id: do_pos
    Apply spring forces to object position (@P).
    
Rotation:
    #id: do_rot
    Apply spring forces to object orientation.
    
Scale:
    #id: do_scale
    Apply spring forces to object scales.
    
Falloff:
    #id: do_falloff
    Apply spring forces to the mops_falloff attribute.
    
Sequence Time:
    #id: do_time
    Apply spring forces to the frame index of a file sequence (Alembic or packed disk sequence).
