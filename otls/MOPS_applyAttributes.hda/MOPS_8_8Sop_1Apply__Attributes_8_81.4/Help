"""Applies instancing attributes to packed primitives."""

This is a low-level node intended to help artists develop their own MOPs modifiers. The Apply Attributes node takes point attributes from points in the second input, and applies them to the packed primitive intrinsics of the MOPs primitives in the first input.
This node can also output the results of the operation to standard Houdini template point attributes, like p@orient, v@scale and f@pscale.

This node recognizes the following attributes: `p@orient`, `v@up`, `v@N`, `v@scale`, `f@pscale`, and `v@euler`. 

== Overview ==

@inputs

Packed Primitives:
    Plug in MOPs primitives, or any packed primitives, here.
    
Template Points:
    Plug in matching template points with instancing attributes (@P, @orient, @scale, @pscale, etc) here. Points are matched by id.
    
@parameters

== Transformation ==

Do Translate:
    #id: do_translate
    
    Toggle translating of MOPs primitives.
    
Do Rotate:
    #id: do_rotate
    
    Toggle rotation of MOPs primitives. If an attribute called v@euler exists on the template points, MOPs will build a quaternion from this instead of using @orient.
    
Do Scale:
    #id: do_scale
    
    Toggle scaling of MOPs primitives. v@scale and @pscale are both supported.
    
Do Pivots:
    #id: do_pivots
    
    Match the pivots from the first input to those of the second input. If the second input has a v@pivot point attribute, this will take precedence over a pivot intrinsic attribute.
    
Local Space:
    #id: local_space
    
    Apply transformations in local space (meaning, relative to the current orientation of the primitives). If this is disabled, transformations will happen in world space.
    
Rotate Mode:
    #id: rotate_mode
    
    * Add: Add the rotation of the template points to the existing rotation (default).
    * Set: Overwrite the existing rotation with the rotation of the template points.
    
Rotate Order:
    #id: rotate_order
    If applying Euler rotations from the second input (defined by the v@euler point attribute), the order in which the rotations are applied.
    
Scale Mode:
    #id: scale_mode
    
    * Multiply: Multiply scaling operations together (default). 
    * Replace: Overwrite the existing scale with the scale of the template points.
    
    
== Falloff ==
    
Do Falloff:
    #id: do_falloff
    
    Apply falloff to the transformations. Falloff in MOPs is defined by the point attribute @mops_falloff, with values typically between 0-1. A falloff of 0 implies no transformation.

Falloff Attribute:
    #id: falloff_attribute
    
    The point attribute to use as the falloff attribute.
    
Ignore Zero Falloff Prims:
    #id: ignore_no_falloff
    Objects with a @mops_falloff value of 0.0 will be completely ignored. This can speed up operations with lots of primitives.
    
== Attributes ==

Copy Attributes:
    #id: do_copy_attrs
    Enable the copying of attributes from the second input to the first.
    
Attributes to Copy:
    #id: attribname
    
    A space-separated list of attributes from the Template Points can be provided here. These attributes will be copied to the MOPs packed primitives.
    
    
Create Id Attr If Missing:
    #id: do_make_id
    If the incoming primitives don't have an i@id attribute, create one based on the primitive number.
    
Output Orient Attribute:
    #id: do_orient
    If enabled, write the resulting orientation to the `p@orient` point attribute as well as transforming any packed primitives.
    
Output Scale Attribute:
    #id: do_output_scale
    If enabled, write the resulting scale to the `v@scale` and `f@pscale` point attributes as well as transforming any packed primitives.
