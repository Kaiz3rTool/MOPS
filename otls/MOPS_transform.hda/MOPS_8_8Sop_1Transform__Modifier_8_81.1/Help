"""Transforms MOPs packed primitives."""

The MOPs Transform Modifier can add to or directly set the transforms of MOPs primitives. Transforms can either be applied in local space (relative to the orientation of each primitive), or in world space (aligned to the world axes).

== Overview ==

@inputs

MOPs Primitives:
    The MOPs packed primitives to transform.
    
@parameters

== General ==

Ignore Zero Falloff Prims:
    #id: ignore_no_falloff
    Ignore any packed primitives with a falloff value of zero. This can make the Transform Modifier more efficient when lots of packed primitives have a falloff value of zero, but can result in unexpected behavior if the falloff attribute hasn't been initialized.

Local Space:
    #id: local
    
    Apply the transformations in local space (relative to each clone's orientation). If this flag is disabled, objects will transform in world space.
    
Translate:
    #id: translate
    
    Translate each clone in world units.
    
Rotate:
    #id: rotate
    
    Rotate each clone, in degrees.
    
Scale:
    #id: scale
    
    Scale each clone.
    
Uniform Scale:
    #id: uniform_scale
    
    A scale applied to all axes simultaneously.
    
    
Pivot:
    #id: pivot
    Apply an offset to the pivot point of each primitive.
    
Do Falloff:
    #id: do_weight
    
    Use the @mops_falloff point attribute to weight the effect of the transformation. A value of 0 implies no transformation will happen.

Use VEXpression:
    #id: do_vexpression
    Enable the use of custom VEX to modify the parameters of this modifier per-primitive.
    
Rotate Mode:
    #id: rotate_mode
    
    Choose Add to have the rotations added (or multiplied, in quaternion terms) to the existing rotation of each clone.
    Choose Set to directly set the absolute rotation of each clone.
    
Scale Mode:
    #id: scale_mode
    
    Choose Multiply to multiply the Scale and Uniform Scale values against the existing scale. This is the typical expected use: a scale of 1.0 implies no effect.
    Choose Replace to directly set the absolute scale of each clone. A scale of 1.0 would imply the original scale of the source object connected to the MOPs Cloner.
    
Rotate Order:
    #id: rotate_order
    The order in which rotations are applied. Certain combinations of rotations can result in gimbal lock, which can sometimes be avoided by using a different rotation order.
    
Pivot Mode:
    #id: pivot_mode
    The method by which the object's new pivot is defined.
        * Add: The pivot is considered an "offset" to the current pivot. The default 0,0,0 means "no change."
        * Set: The pivot is an absolute position in world space. The default 0,0,0 means "world origin."
