"""Sweeps a crossection along a backbone to create geometry."""

This node creates a sweep spline using a cross section (closed polygon) and a backbone (polyline). The swept geometry will automatically be given vertex UVs.

TIP:
        If your cross-section has UVs, they should be aligned to the V (vertical) axis. If you're using the original UVs from the backbone geometry, they should be aligned to the U (horizontal) axis.

== Overview ==

@inputs

Crosssection:
    Cross section of resulting sweep. This should be a closed polygon, or a polyline for flat ribbons.
    
    
Backbone:
    Path to sweep cross section along.
    
@parameters

== Cross-Section ==

Resample:
    #id: do_xsection_resample
    Resamples the cross-section geometry. See the Resample SOP for information on specific parameters.
    
== Backbone ==

Resample:
    #id: do_backbone_resample
    Resamples the backbone curve. See the Resample SOP for information on specific parameters.
    
Orient Curve:
    #id: do_backbone_orient
    Reorients the backbone. This can also be used to "twist" the curve so that the swept geometry twists over its length. 
    
    NOTE: If you reorient a curve that animates over time, the orientation is not guaranteed to be stable!
    
Join Curve Ends:
    #id: do_closed
    Close the curve into a continuous loop.
    
Carve Start:
    #id: domainu1
    Cuts off the beginning of the curve. See the Carve SOP for details.
    
Carve End:
    #id: domainu2
    Cuts off the end of the curve. See the Carve SOP for details.
    
    NOTE: If your swept geometry seems to "loop back" from the end of the curve back to the start, try enabling Carve End and leaving it at the default 1.
    
=== Orient Tab ===

See [MOPs Orient Curve|Node:/sop/MOPS--Orient_Curve-1.0] for details.

=== Scale Tab ===

Scale Mult:
    #id: scale_mult
    A global scale multiplier on the cross-sections. This control is on the backbone section because it directly interacts with the other controls here.
    
Scale by Point Attribute:
    #id: do_scale_attr
    Multiply the global cross-section scale by a point attribute on the backbone (default `pscale`).
    
Scale Attr:
    #id: scale_attr
    The point attribute on the backbone to scale the cross-sections by.
    
Scale Ramp:
    #id: scale_ramp
    A ramp to multiply the cross-section scale by, along the length of the backbone.
    
== Output ==

Reverse Surface:
    #id: do_reverse
    Reverses the swept surface. If the output appears tinted blue, try toggling this.
    
Create Caps:
    #id: do_caps
    Add caps to the swept surface. Only useful if the cross-section geometry is a closed polygon.
    
Use Existing Backbone UVs:
    #id: do_custom_uv
    If enabled, use a defined point attribute on the backbone to define the UVs. This can be useful if your backbone length animates over time.
    This attribute can be a vector or float, but only the first component of a vector attribute is used.
    
UV Attribute:
    #id: uv_attr_name
    If Use Existing Backbone UVs is enabled, this is the point attribute to use for the backbone UVs.
    
UV Scale:
    #id: uv_scale
    A scaling factor applied to the swept UVs, in the U and V directions respectively.
    
Cap UV Scale:
    #id: uv_cap_scale
    A scaling factor applied to the UVs of the caps, if generated.
