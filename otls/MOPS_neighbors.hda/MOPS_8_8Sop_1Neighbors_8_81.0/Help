""" Stores nearby primitives to a point attribute, or uses the stored attribute to connect points with polylines and compute distances. """

The MOPs Neighbors SOP can be used to store neighboring points at a specified frame to a point attribute, which can be used to connect points together, compute distance-based falloffs, and other interesting effects.
This SOP creates the i[]@mops_neighbors point attribute.

== Overview ==
@inputs
Packed Primitives:
    The input primitives to compute neighbors from.
    
@outputs
Packed Primitives:
    The packed primitives with any new attributes applied.
    
Neighbors Network:
    Any generated polylines connecting neighbors together.
    
== General ==

@parameters

Mode:
    #id: mode
    The operation mode, either finding or restoring neighbors information.
        * Find Neighbors: Given a search radius, store the i[]@mops_neighbors point attribute.
        * Connect to Neighbors: Use the i[]@mops_neighbors attribute to create polylines connecting neighbors.
        
== Find ==

Reference Frame:
    #id: frame
    The frame in the timeline used to compute neighbors based on position (@P).
    
Connection Method:
    #id: connect_method
    The method by which neighbors are determined. 
    * Find Nearest: Search all points within the Search Radius, up to the maximum defined by Max Connections.
    * Start/End Groups: As above, but only connect points in the Start Group to those in the Ends Group.
    
Search Radius:
    #id: searchradius
    The maximum distance to look for neighbors. This distance is multiplied against point scale (@pscale).
    
Assume Uniform Scale:
    #id: uniformradius 
    Assume that all incoming packed primitives have the same scale. This speeds up search somewhat.
    
Max Connections:
    #id: maxsearchpoints
    The maximum number of neighbors to store in the array attribute.
    
== Connect to Neighbors ==

Reference Frame:
    #id: frame2 
    The frame to use when reconstructing the neighbors network. By default this is the current frame.

Compute Distance:
    #id: do_edge_transport
    Use Edge Transport to compute the distance from any points in the Start Point Group to any other points.
    
Falloff Determines Start Points:
    #id: do_falloff_root
    Instead of explicitly defining the Start Point Group from a point group, any points with a @mops_falloff value greater than the Falloff Start Threshold will be considered a Start Point.
    
Use Max Distance:
    #id: use_max_distance
    Only connect neighbors within the specified Max Distance.
