"""Aims MOPs primitives towards target points."""

The MOPs Aim Modifier orients packed primitives towards a target point, or multiple target points.

== Overview ==

@inputs

MOPs Primitives:
    The packed primitives to orient.
    
Optional Aim Target Points:
    A SOP for the packed primitives to orient towards.
    
@parameters

== General ==

Group:
    #id: group
    The group of packed primitives to affect.
    
Do Falloff:
    #id: do_falloff
    Enable the falloff attribute. The aim orientation will be blended with the original orientation based on this attribute's value.
    
Falloff Attribute:
    #id: falloff_attribute
    The name of the point attribute to use as the falloff attribute.
    
Aim Method:
    #id: aim_type
    The method by which to aim the primitives.
    * Target Position:
        Aim towards the specified position vector.
    * Target Object:
        Aim towards the centroid of the object connected to the Aim Target Points input.
    * Aim Per Point:
        Each primitive is aimed towards a point with the matching id attribute or point number if no id attribute exists.
        
Use Up Attribute:
    #id: use_up_attr
    In Aim Per Point mode, use each point's v@up attribute instead of this node's global Up Vector.
    
Up Vector:
    #id: up
    The global up vector to use when orienting primitives.
    
Aim Position:
    #id: t
    In Target Position mode, the position to aim towards.
