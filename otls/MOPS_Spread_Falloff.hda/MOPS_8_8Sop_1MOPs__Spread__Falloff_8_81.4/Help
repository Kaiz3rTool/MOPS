"""Creates a falloff that spreads outwards from source points."""

The MOPs Spread Falloff creates an animatable falloff based on a set of starting points. These points can be a group of points or MOPs
primitives, or an arbitrary set of points connected to the second input, or a group defined by an existing attribute.

@parameters

Falloff Attribute:
    #id: falloff_attr
    The point attribute to use as the falloff attribute.
    
Blend Mode:
    #id: input
    The blend mode for combining the effects of this operator with any previous falloff value. See [MOPs Combine Falloffs|Node:sop/MOPS--Combine_Falloffs-1.0] for details.

Blend Strength:
    #id: strength
    The blend weight for the value generated by this Falloff.
    
Clamp:
    #id: switchclamp
    Clamp the resulting Falloff value to a 0-1 range.
    
Preview Falloff:
    #id: do_preview
    Enable display of the falloff values in the viewport.

== Start Points ==

Start Points Mode:
    #id: spread_mode
    The method by which the start points are defined. This can be one of three options: a set of points connected to the second input
    (Point Cloud), a group of points in the first input (Group Mask), or an attribute on the points in the first input (Attribute).
    
    === Point Cloud ===
    
    These settings are based on the Attribute Transfer SOP. See the help on Attribute Transfer for details.
    
    === Group Mask ===
    
    Start Point Group:
        #id: basegroup
        The group of points that will act as starting points for the spread.
        
    === Attribute ===
    
    Attribute Name:
        #id: bindname1
        The attribute that will determine the starting points of the spread.
        
    Threshold:
        #id: threshold2
        The minimum value of the attribute that determines the point to be a start point.
        
== Animate ==

Distance Metric:
    #id: distance_metric
    The method by which neighboring points are determined. This effects the way the falloff spreads over the surface or input MOPs.
    The "Radius" setting will search for neighboring points based on a search radius, similar to the Connect Adjacent Pieces SOP. The
    "Connectivity" setting will search for neighboring points using the surface topology.
    
Reference Frame:
    #id: frame
    The frame to use when analyzing the input points/MOPs/mesh. You can lock this to a particular frame if you don't want animation to 
    affect the distance calculations.
    
Search Radius:
    #id: searchradius
    Radius mode only. The maximum distance for points/MOPs to search for neighboring points. If this is too low, the spread may fail.
    
Max Connections:
    #id: maxsearchpoints
    Radius mode only. The maximum number of neighboring points to consider. Higher numbers may increase the speed of the spread, and affect the pattern.
    
Spread:
    #id: spread
    This animates the spread effect. With default settings, a value of 0 means that the falloff value is unaffected. A value of 1 means that
    the spread is finished. If Falloff Width is greater than 0, you will need to increase this value above 1 to complete the spread.
    
Use Noise:
    #id: do_noise
    Adds noise to the initial "cost" calculation that determines the spread. This can help break up the leading edge of the effect.
    
== Remap ==

See the [MOPs Remap Falloff SOP|Node:sop/MOPS--Remap_Falloff-1.0] for details.
