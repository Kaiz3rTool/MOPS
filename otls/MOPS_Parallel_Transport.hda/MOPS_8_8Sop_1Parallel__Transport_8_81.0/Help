"""Transports an orthogonal frame along a spline."""

This is an implementation of the Parallel Transport algorithm. It computes an orientation frame on a curve that is much less likely to flip or otherwise have discontinuities than the Polyframe SOP.
For more information, see this [Entagma video|http://www.entagma.com/td-fundamentals-parallel-transport/].

TIP:
    This node is used internally by the [MOPs Orient Curve|Node:sop/MOPS--Orient_Curve-1.0] SOP, which is probably what you're looking for.

== Overview ==

@inputs
    
Spline:
    Plug in a spline (polyline) to use as guide to move referencce frame.

@parameters
