""" Converts existing primitives to MOPs-compatible packed primitives. """

MOPs Convert can convert existing primitives, packed or not, into MOPs-compatible packed primitives. This could be used to allow for MOPs operations on voronoi-shattered pieces, for example.
This operator adds and/or modifies the following point attributes: s@name, i@id, f@mops_falloff, and v@rest.

By default, this node creates packed fragments, which are more efficient if all of your pieces are unique. However, packed fragments cannot preview Falloff in the viewport.

@inputs

Primitives To Convert:
    The primitives to convert into MOPs packed primitives.
    
== General ==

@parameters

Unpack:
    #id: do_unpack
    Unpack incoming packed primitives before conversion.
    
Transfer Attributes:
    #id: transfer_attributes
    If these attributes exist on the source geometry, transfer them to the MOPs packed primitives.
    
Use Existing Name Attr:
    #id: use_name
    If the incoming primitives have an s@name attribute, this will be used when assembling the MOPs packed primitives so that primitives with matching names are treated as a single object.
    
Name Prefix:
    #id: prefix
    The prefix to use for the generated s@name attribute. Objects going into a Packed RBD simulation must have unique s@name attributes to solve as separate pieces.
    
Use Existing Id Attr:
    #id: use_id
    If the incoming primitives have an i@id attribute, use this as the i@id of the output MOPs packed primitives.
    
Start Number:
    #id: startindex
    The starting number to use for both the i@id attribute and the s@name suffix.
    
Create Packed Fragments:
    #id: packedfragments
    Create packed fragments instead of standard packed primitives. This means that each chunk contains a reference to the entire original geometry, which can speed up performance if each piece is unique, such as from a voronoi shatter.
    NOTE: As of Houdini 16.5.439, packed fragments cannot display any color attributes that were modified after the pack operation. This means previewing falloff or modifying colors will not work in the viewport.
    
Rest Frame:
    #id: rest_frame
    When computing the v@rest attribute for MOPs, the frame in which the rest attribute will be generated from.
