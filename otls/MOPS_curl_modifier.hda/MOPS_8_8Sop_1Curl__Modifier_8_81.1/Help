"""Moves instances along a curl noise field."""

NOTE:
    This operator is deprecated and may be removed in the future. Consider using the [MOPs Noise Modifier|Node:/sop/MOPS--Noise_Modifier-1.1] instead.

This node uses the falloff value to move instances through a curl noise field, and optionally generates trails following the movement.
Curl Noise is non-divergent, meaning objects flowing through it will not self-collide. It can be very useful for cheaply simulating smoke-like effects.

MOPs is based on a falloff value (usually in the range of 0-1). The falloff value controls how strongly instances will be affected by modifiers.

@parameters

== General ==

Mode:
    #id: curlmode
    Select how instances will be moved through curl noise field.
    - Simple: Simply move instances in the direction of the curl vector.
    - Advect: Advect instances through curl noise field over time (hit play to see effect).
    
Effect Scale:
    #id: scale
    A global multiplier on the strength of the effect.
    
Orient Instances:
    #id: orientclones
    Orient instances according to their motion through the curl noise field.
    
Output Trails:
    #id: do_trails
    Generate trails from the path of each object. Only available in Advect mode.
    
== Curl Noise Properties ==
    
Amplitude:
    #id: amplitude
    The strength of the noise field in each axis.
    
Frequency:
    #id: frequency
    The frequency of the noise field in each axis.
    
Offset:
    #id: offset
    The positional offset of the noise field in each axis.
    
Aim Weight:
    #id: aim_weight
    Available in Advect Mode only. The bias between the previous timestep's orientation and the current timestep's. Lower numbers
    make instances turn towards the direction of motion more slowly. A value of 1.0 implies that all objects will immediately turn
    towards their direction of motion each frame. This can cause jittery motion, so use with caution.
    
== Trail Settings ==

Trails are only available in Advect mode.
    
Polyline Trails:
    #id: do_polylines
    Generate polylines as trails. If disabled, only points will be generated.
    
Group Name:
    #id: groupname
    The point group created for the trails.
    
Inherit Attributes:
    #id: trail_attrs
    A list of attributes for the trails to inherit from the source MOPs.
    
== Solver Settings ==

Update Attributes:
    #id: attribname
    A list of attributes to update from SOPs each timestep. By default, the mops_falloff attribute will be updated each frame. You can
    add extra attributes to this list as needed.

See the Solver SOP for details. Use the Reset Simulation button to see changes after adjusting parameters in Advect mode.
